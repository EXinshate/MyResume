<!-- About Me Section -->
<section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I hold a master's degree and have a solid academic background and practical experience. I am passionate about programming and technological innovation. During my undergraduate studies, I passed the College English Test Band 6 (CET-6) with a score of 460, obtained a C1 driver's license, and earned the National Computer Rank Examination Level 2 MS Office Certificate. In my first and second years, I served as a member of the University Youth League Committee's Propaganda Department and Vice President of the Network Civilization Promotion Association, participating in organizing and promoting campus activities. I am proficient in Adobe Premiere and Photoshop, wrote press releases, and was awarded the title of "Outstanding Liaison Officer of Guizhou University" in 2017, gaining rich teamwork experience.</p>
    <p>During my graduate studies, I received multiple academic scholarships and published a research paper as the first author in the core journal *Seeds*. I self-studied Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Cloud, MySQL, RESTful API, TCP/IP protocols, Maven, Git, Linux, Python, C language, MATLAB, data structures and algorithms, and design patterns (such as MVC, Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.), and applied them in project practice. I also created a GitHub page to document project practices and learning experiences, and explored the use of artificial intelligence technologies to solve practical problems.</p>
    <p>As a full-stack developer, I focus on building efficient and scalable web applications, committed to enhancing user experience through technological innovation. I am familiar with agile development processes and can quickly adapt to new technologies and apply them in real-world projects.</p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <article>
        <h3>Backend Development Intern</h3>
        <p><em>Quadratic Network Co., Ltd. | January 2024 - June 2025</em></p>
        <h4>Project: Microservices E-Commerce System Based on Spring Cloud</h4>
        <p><strong>Project Description:</strong> Developed a microservices-based e-commerce system to provide users with an efficient and reliable online shopping experience. The system adopts a microservices architecture and includes the following core components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Eureka Server:</strong> Serves as the service registration and discovery center, managing the registration and discovery of various microservices to ensure dynamic calls and load balancing between services.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Product Service:</strong> Manages product information, including CRUD operations, category management, and inventory management. By caching hot data with Redis, the product query response time was reduced from 200ms to 50ms.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Order Service:</strong> Handles order-related operations, including order creation, query, update, and deletion. Asynchronous order processing was implemented using RabbitMQ to improve system throughput.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User Service:</strong> Manages user registration, login, and information management. User authentication and permission management were implemented using JWT to ensure data security.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>API Gateway:</strong> Serves as the system's entry point, responsible for request routing, load balancing, and permission verification. Unified API management was achieved using Zuul, simplifying the interaction between clients and backend services.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Database:</strong> MySQL was used as the primary data storage, with a sharding strategy to improve system scalability and performance. ORM was implemented using Hibernate to simplify database operations.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Spring Cloud, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Hibernate, MyBatis, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Git, Maven, Docker</p>
        <p><strong>Project Achievements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Successfully launched the microservices e-commerce system, supporting over 100,000 daily users with 99.9% system stability.</li>
            <li>Optimized system performance using Redis caching and message queues, reducing response time by 60% and improving order processing efficiency by 50%.</li>
            <li>Implemented a highly available and scalable microservices architecture, laying a solid foundation for future feature expansion.</li>
